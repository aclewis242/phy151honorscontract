### *Written report included*

This project takes a given charge distribution and generates a 3D visualisation of their equipotential surfaces. They are represented as a contour plot, the 2D equivalent being equipotential line diagrams.

All code can be found in `eqsurfacemodelling.ipynb`. The charge distribution can be either specified by the user directly or loaded from a file (`.dat`, e.g. `Proton.dat`), depending on what they enter into the console when prompted.

Required packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`
- `sys`
